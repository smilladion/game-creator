# Location-specific game creation environment
This project is associated with the <em>Software Development</em> bachelor thesis of Smilla Maria Dion and Kirstine Berg JÃ¸rgensen at the IT University of Copenhagen.

## Description
If you want to create your own online puzzle or mini-game, the current possibilities are limited. One option is to upload a picture on a website, and it will be made into puzzle pieces. Another option is to upload some words, and it makes them into a crossword puzzle. But what if it was possible to create any kind of puzzle? Where you could make buttons, secret messages, passwords and more.

We want to investigate how to create an environment that allows non-programmers to create and customize puzzles.

Goal:
- To have a functioning Android mobile application, where users can create their own location-based mini-games or puzzles using their surroundings, and where other users can solve or play those games by traveling to the specific location. 
- To make people look at the world differently, and getting inspired by our surroundings to create small games for the community of users.
